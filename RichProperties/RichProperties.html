			<b>Motivation</b><br>
			This visualisation was made after seeing a rather sceptical video of "The School of Life". This is an educational organisation focused on informing people about various aspects of life. In the video they assign certain characteristics to prosperous countries. These characteristics seemed odd and further research revealed that "The School of Life" has no reliable source to substantiate these characteristics. I decided to take matters into my own hands and give users the opportunity to investige the correlation between the prosperity of a country and the different characteristics.<br>
			The characteristics that the school of life assign to prosperous countries are: <u>Military Security</u>, <u>Corruption</u> & <u>Tele communications</u><br>
			In the dictionary, "military security" is defined as "<i>the ability of a country to defend itself</i>". I decided to use the absolute budget (in US dollars) that a country invests in its military forces to investigate this praticular characteristic. Telecommunications are defined as followed: "<i>the exchange of information over significant distances by electronic means</i>" so for this characteristic I took the amount of internet users per 100 people. The values for corruptions require some more information. These values were obtained from Transparency International (TI), which publishes the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), ranking countries "<i>by their perceived levels of corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys.</i>" The CPI generally defines corruption as "<i>the misuse of public power for private benefit.</i>"<br><br>
			<b>Usage</b><br>
			Below this text you'll find an interactive worldmap. When you click your country of interest a scatterplot and a barchart will apprear below the worldmap. Hovering over the dots in the scatterplot and the bars in the barcharts will make a small tooltip appear displaying the data of these elements. The green buttons can be used to switch between characteristics and the random button lets you choose between the 3 characteristics and creates a barchart with random data.<br><br>
			<b>Conclusion</b><br>
			The overall results of these visualisations are for ones own interpretation. Considering that the "The School of Life" did not include any specific definitions of the characteristics, making any bold claims about the data I used would be unjust. If anyone would still make these claims, I do not hold myself accountable. Do you think "The School of Life"  is the right organisation, or would "The school of Lies" be more suitable? See for yourself!
